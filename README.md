# iotaAirgappedClientServerWallet
This is the last piece of the puzzle in [The PrivateKeyVault family of repositories](https://github.com/johnshearing).  
It's starting out as NodeJS code generator and database on it's way to becoming a wallet for IOTA.  
When it matures it will be the first full blown accounting system for IOTA that machines, individuals, corporations, and goverments can use for managing their business and for cooperating with each other.  
This work in progress is a continuation of tutorial [IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet](https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet).  
 
This wallet is being constructed using the methods shown in the following tutorial:  
[The NodeJS Master Class - No Frameworks, No NPM, No Dependencies](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class)  
No dependencies makes for easy auditing.  

This app runs in the browser using NodeJS Client server architecture.  
It runs on a single airgapped [PrivateKeyVault](https://github.com/johnshearing/PrivateKeyVault) for individuals or on an airgapped network for large institutions or government. In the alternative, all this code will run on any device that runs NodeJS.  

When this wallet is finished, a video tutorial will be made explaining each line of code so you can write everything from scratch if you want to. This will facilitate an audit.  

Let's get started.   
To use this application simply follow the instructions below.  

#### Install NodeJS on your airgapped machine and your online machine as well.  
* You are probably wondering, how am I supposed to install software on an airgapped machine that does not connect to the Internet?  
* Well your airgapped machine is not airgapped until you say it's airgapped so for right now it's ok to connect to the Internet.  
* When all the software is installed and you are ready to sign transactions, then you simply pull the plug on the Internet and never connect to it again.  
* Then you will create new seeds and new addresses from behind the airgap and use these instead of the experimental ones you are playing with now.  
* If you are using a PrivateKeyVault or a raspberry pi 2 then NodeJS installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/johnshearing/PrivateKeyVault#install-nodejs-and-npm).  
* Otherwise download NodeJS for your system [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).   


#### Install iota.js  
* [Check out the documentation - found here](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/blob/next/api_reference.md)  
* [The iota.js library and install instructions are found here](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js).  
* To install:  
  * Make a new directory on each machine. Call it **iotajs**.  
  * At the bash console, cd into the directory.  
  * Execute the following command at the bash console to create a package.json file.  
  * The package.json file is used to manage your project.  
  * `npm init`  Accept all the defaults.  
  * Next install the iota.js library by executing the following command at the bash console.  
  * `npm install @iota/core`  

#### Install the IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet repository  
* At the BASH command line, cd into the **iotajs** directory you just made.  
* Then execute the following command at the BASH console.   
* `git clone https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet.git`  
* Now the Console Wallet is installed in a new directory called **IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet**  
* Change the name of the directory to something shorter. Call it **Console-Wallet**  
* At the BASH console, CD into the **Console-Wallet** directory and look at the scripts with your favorite text editor.  
* You will be using these scripts at the BASH console to securely store and spend your IOTAs.  

#### Start the Application  
 Run the following command to start the NodeJS server:  
 `node ./index.js`  
 Finally, open your browser and enter the following address:  
 `http://localhost:3000/`  
 You should see the application running in your browser.
 
 The app runs well but it doesn't do anything IOTA related yet.  
 IOTA functionality will be built in very shortly.  
 The focus now is on getting the framework right.  
 Then building on top of this framework will go quickly.  
 
 The wallet will:  
 * Have database functionality. 
   * Table locking and/or field locking will be used to make the application multiuser.  
   * Transaction rollbacks will be implemented if any part of the transaction fails.  
   * All records/documents in the database (no matter from what table/collection) will get their unique ids from a single incremented source so that every record/document has a system wide unique id that identifies when it was created with respect to all the other records/documents in the database. You will see why in a minute.  
   * Any adds, changes, or deletes to a record/document will be recorded in a log that captures the entire record/document in it's new state. This along with the system wide unique ids allows the entire database to be reconstructed to represent any point in history.  
   * There are 4 database choices to consider SQL, NoSQL, JSON in text files, The Tangle. The application is being roughed out now with a JSON database [taught by Leslie Lewis in his NodeJS Master Class](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class). Once there is something to play with it can be decided which database(s) should be used.  
 * Have a code generator.
   * Rather than writing post, get, put, delete, validation, and user interface functions for every table/collection, there will be templates instead that get populated with metadata including all the business rules that make each table/collection and each field unique. It is common practice to use templates and metadata for generating html and JavaScript on the fly for browser consumption. We are simply extending the practice for the server side NodeJS code as well.  
   * First a simple app will be written and tested. Then templates will be made for every type of function using the simple app as a model. From that point on, any changes to the app are made in the templates and the metadata. After the changes are made, the application is regenerated. This way, major changes to functionality ripple down through the system without having to change the handlers for each table/collection and their user interfaces. This eliminates most programming errors and makes it possible to make big changes to the system as we try to figure out what works and what does not. I did this about 20 years ago using Delphi and SQL Server. It worked great. Now I am going to do it again using NodeJS and JavaScript.  
 * [Generate truly random seeds](https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet#generating-seeds-with-a-true-random-number-generator) (not pseudo-random) with special hardware built into every raspberry pi 2, or use another method if you want,
 * Generate keystore files for seeds.  
   * This is an encrypted file containing just a seed.  
   * You could give the file to other people to hold for you but they would not be able to access the seed without your password.  
   * This provides a secure way to store seeds in an other location before putting IOTAs in any addresses generated by that seed.  
   * There will be tears and gnashing of teeth for those who use a seed before making several keystore files and storing them in different secure locations.
 * [Identify healthy nodes](https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet#find-a-healthy-computer-on-the-tangle-to-use-for-checking-the-balance-of-your-new-address),   
 * [Generate addresses and check balances for a single address or for a list of addresses](https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet#check-your-balance-at-address-a0),   
   * The wallet does NOT check seed balances directly. This is for security reasons.  
   * Instead, the list of addresses generated by the seed is supplied by the database. The balances of each address can be checked and added up to give the seed's balance. This way you can get the seed balance without exposing your seed to any other device.
   * Working this way also eliminates the confusion created by snap shots.  
 * [Bundle Transactions Offline then Broadcast Transactions Online,](https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet#make-a-signed-transaction-bundle-and-broadcast-it-to-the-tangle)   
   * Users will see a visual representation of actions the bundle will perform as check before broadcasting bundle.  
   * If the bundle does not make it onto the tangle within a set period of time the bundle will be promoted, reattached, or rebroadcast.  
   * And if the bundle is still not accepted after several attempts then a text message will be transmitted to the sender's phone.    
 * [Handle Multi-Signatures building upon work found here](https://www.mobilefish.com/services/cryptocurrency/iota_multisig.html),  
 * MAM Masked Authenticated Messaging,  
 * Implement all the functionality available through Qubic as that comes online,  
 * Implement typical accounting functions such as AP, AR, GL, Inv ...  
 
 Check back often to follow the progress.  
 Feel free to make suggestions or help with the coding.  
 Thanks, John
