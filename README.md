# iotaAirgappedClientServerWallet
 This work in progress is a continuation of tutorial [IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet](https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet). When the wallet is finished a tutorial will be made in the style of [The NodeJS Master Class - No Frameworks, No NPM, No Dependencies](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class). No dependencies for easy auditing. And a tutorial explaining each line of code where you can write everything from scratch if you want to. Client server architecture runs on a single airgapped [PrivateKeyVault](https://github.com/johnshearing/PrivateKeyVault) for individuals or on an airgapped network for large institutions. In the alternative, all this code will run on any device that runs NodeJS.  
 
 To use this code, simply install NodeJS on your device and clone this repository.  
 Then from the command line, cd into the folder where this repository has been cloned.  
 Next, run the following command to start the NodeJS server:  
 `node ./index.js`  
 Finally, open your browser and enter the following address:  
 `http://localhost:3000/`  
 
 Everything runs but the app does not do anything IOTA related yet.  
 I am still working on base functionality.  
 Check back often to follow the progress.  
 Feel free to make suggestions.  
 Thanks
