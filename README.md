# iotaAirgappedClientServerWallet
 This work in progress is a continuation of tutorial [IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet](https://github.com/johnshearing/IOTA-Airgapped-NodeJS-Console-Wallet). When the wallet is finished a tutorial will be made in the style of [The NodeJS Master Class - No Frameworks, No NPM, No Dependencies](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class). No dependencies for easy auditing. And a tutorial explaining each line of code where you can write everything from scratch if you want to. Client server architecture runs on a single airgapped [PrivateKeyVault](https://github.com/johnshearing/PrivateKeyVault) for individuals or on an airgapped network for large institutions.
