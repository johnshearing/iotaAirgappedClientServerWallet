All records/documents in the database (no matter from what table/collection) will get their unique ids from a single incremented source so that every record/document has a system wide unique id that identifies when it was created with respect to all the other records/documents in the database. You will see why in a minute.
Any adds, changes, or deletes to a record/document will be recorded in a log that captures the entire record/document in it's new state. This along with the system wide unique ids allows the entire database to be reconstructed to represent any point in history.
